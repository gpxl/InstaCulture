InstaCulture
=========

Inspired by [spot.io](http://spot.io/ "Spot.io"). This takes a set of Instagram [location ids](http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/) (currently set in models/venue.rb) and gathers them for cronological display.

## Get Started

Set Environment Variables for :

INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID and INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET

Update models/venue.rb with your own Instagram location ids

## Want to contribute? Here's a list of todos

  * TESTS! There are none.
  * Pretty up templates (it's all "classic" bootstrap currently)
  * Add Google Maps and Foursquare integration.
  * Auto load images on scroll to page end.
  * Allow arbitrary venues groupings (I want to see a Portland Food Carts group!)
